# HarborFreightDatabase
This is an archive of a project previously worked on during the Fall 2022 semester for COSC 4336 (Software Development)
taken at the University of Texas at Tyler. The tables were filled via web scraper that made calls to the Harbor Freight 
website's API and display as a web page built using next.js. All of my own personal contributions to this project can be
found at the following paths: 

1) hfdb-api-development/src/main/java/info/hfdb/hfdbapi/Controller
2) hfdb-api-development/src/main/java/info/hfdb/hfdbapi/HfdbApiApplication.java

My contributions are a RESTful API built off of the Spring Framework and JDBC accessed through Spring Boot.
I also assisted with designing the SQL table layouts and calls used in the HFDB API.
